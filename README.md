OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 It Feeds and wow, I'm still trying to process. 😅 Seriously, like, what was that ending? You know when you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   'cause everyone’s been hyping it up and then it’s like…really? 😂 Not saying it’s bad, I mean some parts were super intense, but also kinda wacky, in both good and bad ways.

> Honestly, during some scenes, I was just grabbing the nearest pillow to hide behind. But then there were moments like—wait, am I actually smiling right now from a horror  ? Crazy, right?

And oh my god, don’t even get me started on that main character. So much face-palming. Like, dude, why would you even do that? You know what I mean? It's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 someone walk into a room full of mousetraps with their eyes closed. But hey, gotta hand it to them, they committed.

But, dude, the atmosphere was weirdly good? Like, every little sound made me jump. And yeah, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with the lights on if you wanna sleep that night. Trust me.

> Anyway, I kinda lost track of time and now it's like, I'm all wired but sleepy at the same time. If that makes any sense? 😂

Console.WriteLine(Spooky stuff, man!);

So yeah, if you get a chance, sorta worth a look just for the rollercoaster of it all. Catch you later, and seriously, lemme know what you think if you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it too! 🎬💀
